== Description ==

**[Prosperent Suite](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/prosperent-suite/)** 
**The newest Prosperent Plugin, includes all other Prosperent plugins in one.**

* **Please use the Prosperent Suite in place of your Prosperent Auto-Linker.** 
* **This plugin is no longer being updated.**
* **The Prosperent Suite contains the newest version of the Prosperent Auto-Linker and other tools.**

*Prosperent Auto-Linker*

Adds Auto-Linker buttons to HTML and Visual editor in WordPress for pages and posts. When text is highlighted an the button is pressed it will place [linker] short tags around the highlighted phrase connecting it to the Prosperent Product Search. Also puts Auto-Linker settings under the settings menu. Allowing you to link more commonly used phrases.

On the HTML editor the button is named 'auto-linker'. In the Visual Editor, the button is the one with the gears on it.

When using the Visual Editor, a dialog box will pop up when the button is clicked, allowing you to alter the query used with the highlighed phrase. once you hit submit if you changed the query it should look something like [linker q="ipad 4 case"]ipad 4[/linker]. The q variable will change the query used when someone clicks on Ipad 4 within the blog.

*Why Prosperent Auto-Linker?*

This plugin does a couple things. You can map words that appear in posts to product searches. For example, if you configure the plugin like so:

* nike => nike shoes
* soccer cleats

Anytime you publish a wordpress post with the word nike in it, it will be linked to a search result page for nike shoes. If you publish a post with soccer cleats in it, the plugin links you to a soccer cleats product search page.

The second addition is a tool that helps you quickly link words to product search pages when writing a new post. There is a Prosperent gear button. You simply highlight a word or phrase in your post, click the gear and it gets linked to a product search page.

We have an ever growing community, which is always willing to answer questions and lend a helping hand, and our team here at Prosperent is also available on the forum.

Our Community Forums are a fantastic resource. Our entire team is active on a daily basis, and we are always here to lend a helping hand no matter what the question may be.

= How do I get paid? =

Prosperent pays publishers net30 which means we pay you 30 days after commission event takes place. This gives merchants time to see if a product is returned, or otherwise needs to be delayed for whatever reason.

= How can we track our earnings? =

We have a comprehensive reporting system in place that allows you to see which pages are generating earnings, which city/state/country the sales are coming from, and which individual products and retailers are providing those sales.

= What is the revenue split? =

We take a 30% commission and pay you the other 70%. If you are a larger publisher this split changes to 80/20.

= What are the comissions paid and terms? =

The commission rates vary from merchant to merchant, but we are always negotiating the highest rates in the industry. We pay out net30 like most networks. The only exception is when a merchant that we work with extends a commission based on their return policy. Our reporting interface reflects this and allows you to see the status of each commission. It's the same as what you would experience with any of the other affiliate networks like commission junction.
